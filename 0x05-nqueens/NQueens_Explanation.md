Here's a diagrammatic explanation of the N Queens problem and how the backtracking algorithm finds a solution for \( N = 4 \). The goal is to place 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. A queen attacks another if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Step-by-Step Diagram Explanation for N=4

1. **Initial Board State**  
   The algorithm starts with an empty 4x4 board, and it tries to place the first queen in the first row.

   ```
   . . . .    <- Start with an empty board
   . . . .
   . . . .
   . . . .
   ```

2. **Placing the First Queen**  
   The first queen is placed at position (0, 0).

   ```
   Q . . .    <- Queen placed at (0, 0)
   . . . .
   . . . .
   . . . .
   ```

3. **Placing the Second Queen**  
   The algorithm moves to the next row and tries to place the second queen in a position that is not attacked. It places it at (1, 2).

   ```
   Q . . .    <- (0, 0) remains safe
   . . Q .    <- Queen placed at (1, 2)
   . . . .
   . . . .
   ```

4. **Placing the Third Queen**  
   Moving to the third row, it tries to place the third queen. It places it at (2, 3).

   ```
   Q . . .    <- (0, 0) remains safe
   . . Q .    <- (1, 2) remains safe
   . . . Q    <- Queen placed at (2, 3)
   . . . .
   ```

5. **Fourth Queen Cannot be Placed Safely**  
   At this point, no safe position is available for the fourth queen in the last row. The algorithm backtracks.

6. **Backtrack and Move the Third Queen**  
   The third queen is moved from (2, 3) to (2, 1), and the algorithm tries to place the fourth queen again.

   ```
   Q . . .    <- (0, 0) remains safe
   . . Q .    <- (1, 2) remains safe
   . Q . .    <- Queen moved to (2, 1)
   . . . .
   ```

7. **Placing the Fourth Queen**  
   Now, the fourth queen can be safely placed at (3, 2).

   ```
   Q . . .    <- (0, 0) remains safe
   . . Q .    <- (1, 2) remains safe
   . Q . .    <- (2, 1) remains safe
   . . . Q    <- Queen placed at (3, 2)
   ```

### Final Solution Representation

The solution for N=4 is:

```
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```

```

### Key Points

- **Backtracking**: The algorithm places queens one row at a time and backtracks if it hits a dead end.
- **Safe Position Check**: A position is safe if no queens can attack it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This illustrates the dynamic and iterative approach to solving N Queens through backtracking. Each placement is carefully evaluated and adjusted until a complete solution is found.
