# 0x02. Minimum Operations Algorithm Python

## Overview

This project implements an algorithm to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The algorithm is implemented in Python and follows a dynamic programming approach.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Simply clone the repository and run the Python files.

## Usage

To use the `minOperations` function, import it from the `0-minoperations` module and call the function with the desired number of characters as an argument.

```python
minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 9
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

Output:

```
Min # of operations to reach 9 characters: 6
```

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a given number of characters. It follows these steps:

1. Initialize a list `dp` of size `n+1` with all values set to infinity. Set `dp[0]` to 0, as it takes 0 operations to reach 0 characters.
2. Iterate from 1 to `n`.
3. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate from 1 to the square root of `i`.
4. For each `j` from 1 to the square root of `i`, calculate the number of operations required to reach `i` characters by copying `j` characters and pasting them `i // j` times. Update `dp[i]` if the calculated number of operations is smaller than the current value of `dp[i]`.
5. Return `dp[n]` as the minimum number of operations required to reach `n` characters.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)) and a space complexity of O(n).
